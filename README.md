# ContactsAPI
Itâ€™s a simple API, where a user can get a quick overview over all contacts resources
like person, skills...

# Initial Project Setup
The api uses MS SQL Server database. 
Before running the first time, ensure the connection string in appsettings.json is set up right for the situation.
Currerntly, if running in docker, it can't use (localdb) and need path to the server, even if running on local. If running in a windows system with local MS SQL Server or Express, it can work with locladb
Database : ContactDB (or as mentioned in the connectionstring in parameter InitialCataglog
it is ceated the first time, so use need to be authorized to create database
Sample connection string if run in IISExperss on local:
```
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "ConnectionString": "Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=ContactDB;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;Encrypt=False;TrustServerCertificate=False;ApplicationIntent=ReadWrite;MultiSubnetFailover=False"
  },
```
sample If run in Docker and/or to an extenal sqlexpress server using sql user:
```
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "ConnectionString": "Server=hostserver\\sqlexpress;User ID=sa;Password=mYsAb@DpASSW0D;Database=ContactDB;Connect Timeout=5;Encrypt=False;TrustServerCertificate=False;ApplicationIntent=ReadWrite;MultiSubnetFailover=False;"
  },
```

#  Some debatable choices I made
	Provide 2 endpoints for listing Contacts and Skills: 
		GetAll and GetAllNoChild: one with only contact data, one with embedded skills
	Provide 2 endpoints for adding Contacts and Skills: 
		Add and AddWith[Skills/Contact]: one with only contact/skill data, one with embedded skills/contact
	Provide additional Entripoint to manage rrelations:
		/ContactSkills
